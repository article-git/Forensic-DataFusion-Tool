'Forensic-DataFusion-Tool' enables users to preprocess and merge raw and preprocessed data from multiple sensors, speeding up data fusion and enabling future machine learning updates, including classification algorithms. The current version 1.0 of the application allows one to explore the fused data through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
To run the application, open on Visual Studio Code all the python files. You should instal all the packages before using the app.
